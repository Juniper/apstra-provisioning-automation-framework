# | Note that when the Username or Password fields contain special characters and are
# │ embedded in the URL, Terraform required them to be URL-encoded by substituting '%<hex-value>' in
# │ place of each special character. The following table demonstrates some common
# │ substitutions:
# 
# │       " => %22        # => %23        % => %25        / => %2F
# │       < => %3C        > => %3E        ? => %3F        [ => %5B
# │       \ => %5C        ] => %5D        ^ => %5E

# │ To generate 'enconded_password' from 'password' with python3:
#  import urllib.parse
#  urllib.parse.quote(password, safe='')
